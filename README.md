## Description
A dynamic bowling scorecard based on the classic coding kata.

## Approach
I have split the logic into two classes: Game and Frame. The Game class is responsible for storing the frame scores, adding frames and calculating the scores, whereas the Frame class is responsible for calculating if a frame is a strike or a spare. There is also a jQuery interface file which is responsible for all interactivity.
